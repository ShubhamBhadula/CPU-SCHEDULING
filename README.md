# CPU-SCHEDULING
This project implements and demonstrates various CPU Scheduling Algorithms, which are used in operating systems to manage the execution order of processes by the CPU. CPU scheduling is one of the core functions of an OS, aiming to optimize CPU utilization, throughput, turnaround time, waiting time, and response time.
